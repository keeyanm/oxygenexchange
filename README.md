OxygenExchange was a personal initiative I started with my friend Akshat Sethi, as I used over 5 credible data sources to recieve a wide range of oxygen suppliers that I could
corroborate across these sources. Using the search bar, you can search for your state, city, region or a specific supplier to see the name of the person leading it, its location
on an integrated Google Maps on the website itself, a phone number which can be automatically dialed at the press of a button, and most importantly a level of verification 
based on the sources that have verified them, and the date on which these have been done. 

A JavaScript App involving integration with Geolocation with Google Maps.
